| 1 | [Copy Linked List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/) | copy linked list with recursion, create new node before recursive call, use recursive call to assign the copy, and assign random pointer after the recursive call, use hashmap as index old -> new |
| 2 | [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) | iterate through the lists until both of them are none and carry over is 0, add modulus 10 of sum to the new node |
| 3 | [Find Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/) | treat list as linked list, duplicate number will create a cycle, detect cycle, then find the cycle starting point by resetting on pointer to head, you can use bit set |
|4 | [Middle of Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/) | slow and fast pointer|

### **üå≥ Trees**  
| # | Problem | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | [Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/) | bfs, for each node, add its children and current level + 1 to the queue,
 and use hashmap to keep track of node values at each level |
| 2 | [Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/) | DFS: if dfs right child first starting with level 0, at each level append to result the first node visited -> len(result) == depth, BFS: loop through the queue at each level, the last element is the rightmost |
| 3 | [Good Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/description/) | keep track of max in dfs and count when max is updated, start with the root value |
| 4 | [Validate BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/) | validate each node, and the subtree as well, so set a range for each dfs call, right -> node.val is min, left -> node.val is max |
| 5 | [Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/) | inorder traversal of bst gives sorted elements, can keep a decreasing counter after left dfs for more efficient solution |

| 4 | [Islands & Treasure](https://leetcode.com/problems/walls-and-gates/description/) | use bfs, add neighboring lands to queue, loop through the queue at each level and accumulate steps when moving to next level, return the steps count when 0(treasure) is found. |

| 6| [Pacific and Atlantic Ocean](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/) | start from the edges of grid, keep separate sets of visited nodes in pacific and atlantic |
| 7| [Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/description/) | bfs/dfs the graph, check for original color after popping queue, since node in queue may be already changed |
| 8 | [01-Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/) | bfs: start from 0-cell append them to queue, after traversing the matrix, start processing the queue, traverse new cells if their results cell hasn't been computed yet, DP approach: do a two pass from top-left, and then bottom-right |
| 9 | [Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/) | we are excluding edges from modification, so start search from edges, and populate with something else then another loop to capture the rest, turn populated ones to the original value |

|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | [Fibonacci Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/description/) | Memoization(top-down): store value of n in precomputed dict, Tabulation(bottom-up): compute from 2 to n |
| 2 | [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs) | Think of each step of stairs as a node in a tree, taking 1 or 2 step as branches of that node, use DFS to traverse tree, return 0 if current path exceeds target value. |
| 3 | [Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/) | recursion: if current step exceeds length, return 0, memoize it for dp, for bottom up, create an array that stores min of the result of i-1 and i-2, added the cost for those previous steps  |
| 4 | [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber) | subproblem: find max of each subarray for an element of the array, keep prev_1 or keep prev_2 and add self to avoid adjacent values |
