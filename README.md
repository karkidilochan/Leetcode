| # | Problem | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/) | Sliding window: left pointer moves right when difference of max_freq so far and current window length exceeds allowed replacements |

### **üîó Linked List**  
| # | Problem | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | [Copy Linked List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/) | copy linked list with recursion, create new node before recursive call, use recursive call to assign the copy, and assign random pointer after the recursive call, use hashmap as index old -> new |

### **üå≥ Trees**  
| # | Problem | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | [Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/) | bfs, for each node, add its children and current level + 1 to the queue,
 and use hashmap to keep track of node values at each level |

### **‚ö° Heaps / Priority Queue**  
| # | Problem | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | [Example Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/example) | Example note |

### **üó∫Ô∏è Graphs**  
| # | Problem | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | [Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/) | For each element, look in all four directions, and increase perimeter count if reached at the grid edge, or grid block with "0", keep track of visited blocks and avoid them |
| 2 | [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) | For each element, look in all four directions, and do bfs/dfs if element is "1" and has not been visited.|
| 3 | [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/) | bfs/dfs to each node, keep track of new clones with hashmap, and append clones of neighbors to the clone of current node |
| 4 | [Islands & Treasure]() | use bfs, add neighboring lands to queue, loop through the queue at each level and accumulate steps when moving to next level, return the steps count when 0(treasure) is found. |
